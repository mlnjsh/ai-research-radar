    "abstract": "Understanding the complex, multi-agent dynamics of urban traffic remains a fundamental challenge for video language models. This paper introduces Urban Dynamics VideoQA, a benchmark dataset that captures the unscripted real-world behavior of dynamic urban scenes. UDVideoQA is curated from 16 hours of traffic footage recorded at multiple city intersections under diverse traffic, weather, and lighting conditions. It employs an event-driven dynamic blur technique to ensure privacy preservation without compromising scene fidelity. Using a unified annotation pipeline, the dataset contains 28K question-answer pairs generated across 8 hours of densely annotated video, averaging one question per second. Its taxonomy follows a hierarchical reasoning level, spanning basic understanding and attribution to event reasoning, reverse reasoning, and counterfactual inference, enabling systematic evaluation of both visual grounding and causal reasoning. Comprehensive experiments benchmark 10 SOTA VideoLMs on UDVideoQA and 8 models on a complementary video question generation benchmark. Results reveal a persistent perception-reasoning gap, showing models that excel in abstract inference often fail with fundamental visual grounding. While models like Gemini Pro achieve the highest zero-shot accuracy, fine-tuning the smaller Qwen2.5-VL 7B model on UDVideoQA bridges this gap, achieving performance comparable to proprietary systems. In VideoQGen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Qwen3 Max generate the most relevant and complex questions, though all models exhibit limited linguistic diversity, underscoring the need for human-centric evaluation. The UDVideoQA suite, including the dataset, annotation tools, and benchmarks for both VideoQA and VideoQGen, provides a foundation for advancing robust, privacy-aware, and real-world multimodal reasoning. UDVideoQA is available at https://ud-videoqa.github.io/UD-VideoQA/UD-VideoQA/.",

    "abstract": "Qualitative insights from user experiences are critical for informing product and policy decisions, but collecting such data at scale is constrained by the time and availability of experts to conduct semi-structured interviews. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to automate interviewing, yet existing systems lack a principled mechanism for balancing systematic coverage of predefined topics with adaptive exploration, or the ability to pursue follow-ups, deep dives, and emergent themes that arise organically during conversation. In this work, we formulate adaptive semi-structured interviewing as an optimization problem over the interviewer's behavior. We define interview utility as a trade-off between coverage of a predefined interview topic guide, discovery of relevant emergent themes, and interview cost measured by length. Based on this formulation, we introduce SparkMe, a multi-agent LLM interviewer that performs deliberative planning via simulated conversation rollouts to select questions with high expected utility. We evaluate SparkMe through controlled experiments with LLM-based interviewees, showing that it achieves higher interview utility, improving topic guide coverage (+4.7% over the best baseline) and eliciting richer emergent insights while using fewer conversational turns than prior LLM interviewing approaches. We further validate SparkMe in a user study with 70 participants across 7 professions on the impact of AI on their workflows. Domain experts rate SparkMe as producing high-quality adaptive interviews that surface helpful profession-specific insights not captured by prior approaches. The code, datasets, and evaluation protocols for SparkMe are available as open-source at https://github.com/SALT-NLP/SparkMe.",

Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training than prior visual off-policy and on-policy methods. Squint achieves this via parallel simulation, a distributional critic, resolution squinting, layer normalization, a tuned update-to-data ratio, and an optimized implementation. We evaluate on the SO-101 Task Set, a new suite of eight manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 with heavy domain randomization, and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer to a real SO-101 robot. We train policies for 15 minutes on a single RTX 3090 GPU, with most tasks converging in under 6 minutes.",

Late interaction has emerged as a dominant paradigm for information retrieval in text, images, visual documents, and videos, but its computation and storage costs grow linearly with document length, making it costly for image-, video-, and audio-rich corpora. To address this limitation, we explore query-agnostic methods for compressing multi-vector document representations under a constant vector budget. We introduce four approaches for index compression: sequence resizing, memory tokens, hierarchical pooling, and a novel attention-guided clustering (AGC). AGC uses an attention-guided mechanism to identify the most semantically salient regions of a document as cluster centroids and to weight token aggregation. Evaluating these methods on retrieval tasks spanning text (BEIR), visual-document (ViDoRe), and video (MSR-VTT, MultiVENT 2.0), we show that attention-guided clustering consistently outperforms other parameterized compression methods (sequence resizing and memory tokens), provides greater flexibility in index size than non-parametric hierarchical clustering, and achieves competitive or improved performance compared to a full, uncompressed index.

It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks.",

However, their clinical adoption has been hindered by a major requirement: training datasets with manually annotated landmarks that maintain point-to-point correspondences across patients rarely exist in practice. We introduce Mask-HybridGNet, a framework that trains graph-based models directly using standard pixel-wise masks, eliminating the need for manual landmark annotations. Our approach aligns variable-length ground truth boundaries with fixed-length landmark predictions by combining Chamfer distance supervision and edge-based regularization to ensure local smoothness and regular landmark distribution, further refined via differentiable rasterization. A significant emergent property of this framework is that predicted landmark positions become consistently associated with specific anatomical locations across patients without explicit correspondence supervision. This implicit atlas learning enables temporal tracking, cross-slice reconstruction, and morphological population analyses. Beyond direct segmentation, Mask-HybridGNet can extract correspondences from existing segmentation masks, allowing it to generate stable anatomical atlases from any high-quality pixel-based model. Experiments across chest radiography, cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, and fetal imaging demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art pixel-based methods, while ensuring anatomical plausibility by enforcing boundary connectivity through a fixed graph adjacency matrix. This framework leverages the vast availability of standard segmentation masks to build structured models that maintain topological integrity and provide implicit correspondences.",

Such queries are typically only one or two words long, rendering them semantically ambiguous, prone to collisions across diverse visual interpretations, and lacking explicit control over the quality of retrieved images. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm of quality-controllable retrieval, which enriches short queries with contextual details while incorporating explicit notions of image quality. Our key idea is to leverage a generative language model as a query completion function, extending underspecified queries into descriptive forms that capture fine-grained visual attributes such as pose, scene, and aesthetics. We introduce a general framework that conditions query completion on discretized quality levels, derived from relevance and aesthetic scoring models, so that query enrichment is not only semantically meaningful but also quality-aware. The resulting system provides three key advantages: 1) flexibility, it is compatible with any pretrained vision-language model (VLMs) without modification; 2) transparency, enriched queries are explicitly interpretable by users; and 3) controllability, enabling retrieval results to be steered toward user-preferred quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves retrieval results and provides effective quality control, bridging the gap between the expressive capacity of modern VLMs and the underspecified nature of short user queries.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the problem of Encounter-Driven Information Diffusion (EDID). In EDID, robots are allowed to exchange information only upon meeting. Crucially, EDID assumes that the robots are not allowed to schedule their meetings. As such, the robots have no means to anticipate when, where, and who they will meet. As a step towards the design of storage and routing algorithms for EDID, in this paper we propose a model of information diffusion that captures the essential dynamics of EDID. The model is derived from first principles and is composed of two levels: a micro model, based on a generalization of the concept of `mean free path'; and a macro model, which captures the global dynamics of information diffusion. We validate the model through extensive robot simulations, in which we consider swarm size, communication range, environment size, and different random motion regimes. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of this model on the algorithms that best support information diffusion according to the parameters of interest.",

DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries.

One promising application is assisting radiologists in decision-making by the analysis of radiology imaging data such as chest X-rays (CXR) via a visual and natural language question-answering (VQA) interface. When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. The manual longitudinal analysis is a time-consuming process, motivating the development of a training framework that can provide prognostic capabilities. We introduce a novel training framework LUMEN, that is optimized for longitudinal CXR interpretation, leveraging multi-image and multi-task instruction fine-tuning to enhance prognostic and diagnostic performance. We conduct experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and its associated Medical-Diff-VQA datasets. We further formulate and construct a novel instruction-following dataset incorporating longitudinal studies, enabling the development of a prognostic VQA task. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in diagnostic VQA tasks, and more importantly, shows promising potential for prognostic capabilities. These results underscore the value of well-designed, instruction-tuned VLMs in enabling more accurate and clinically meaningful radiological interpretation of longitudinal radiological imaging data.",

However, this deepening trust introduces a novel attack surface: Agent-Mediated Deception (AMD), where compromised agents are weaponized against their human users. While extensive research focuses on agent-centric threats, human susceptibility to deception by a compromised agent remains unexplored. We present the first large-scale empirical study with 303 participants to measure human susceptibility to AMD. This is based on HAT-Lab (Human-Agent Trust Laboratory), a high-fidelity research platform we develop, featuring nine carefully crafted scenarios spanning everyday and professional domains (e.g., healthcare, software development, human resources). Our 10 key findings reveal significant vulnerabilities and provide future defense perspectives. Specifically, only 8.6% of participants perceive AMD attacks, while domain experts show increased susceptibility in certain scenarios. We identify six cognitive failure modes in users and find that their risk awareness often fails to translate to protective behavior. The defense analysis reveals that effective warnings should interrupt workflows with low verification costs. With experiential learning based on HAT-Lab, over 90% of users who perceive risks report increased caution against AMD. This work provides empirical evidence and a platform for human-centric agent security research.",

However, the efficient training of collective robots using multi-agent RL and the transfer of learned policies to real-world applications remain open research questions. In this work, we first develop a comprehensive robotic system, including simulation, distributed learning framework, and physical robot components. We then propose and evaluate reinforcement learning techniques designed for efficient training of cooperative and competitive policies on this platform. To address the challenges of multi-agent sim-to-real transfer, we introduce Out of Distribution State Initialization (OODSI) to mitigate the impact of the sim-to-real gap. In the experiments, OODSI improves the Sim2Real performance by 20%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments with a multi-robot car competitive game and a cooperative task in real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is central to performance optimization in user-centric beamforming for satellite-based non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). Its assessment either requires the transmission of dedicated pilots or relies on computing the beamforming matrix through minimum mean squared error (MMSE)-based formulations beforehand, a process that introduces significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity SINR estimation framework that leverages multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to extract inter-user interference features directly from either channel state information or user location reports. The proposed dual MHSA (DMHSA) models evaluate the SINR of a scheduled user group without requiring explicit MMSE calculations. The architecture achieves a computational complexity reduction by a factor of three in the CSI-based setting and by two orders of magnitude in the location-based configuration, the latter benefiting from the lower dimensionality of user reports. We show that both DMHSA models maintain high estimation accuracy, with the root mean squared error typically below 1 dB with priority-queuing-based scheduled users. These results enable the integration of DMHSA-based estimators into scheduling procedures, allowing the evaluation of multiple candidate user groups and the selection of those offering the highest average SINR and capacity.",

However, high speeds lead to severe motion blur in images and induce significant drift and noise in pose estimates, making dense 3D reconstruction with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) particularly challenging due to their high sensitivity to such degradations. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages asynchronous event streams alongside motion-blurred frames to reconstruct high-fidelity radiance fields from agile drone flights. By embedding event-image fusion into NeRF optimization and jointly refining event-based visual-inertial odometry priors using both event and frame modalities, our method recovers sharp radiance fields and accurate camera trajectories without ground-truth supervision. We validate our approach on both synthetic data and real-world sequences captured by a fast-flying drone. Despite highly dynamic drone flights, where RGB frames are severely degraded by motion blur and pose priors become unreliable, our method reconstructs high-fidelity radiance fields and preserves fine scene details, delivering a performance gain of over 50% on real-world data compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Recent alternatives present a fundamental trade-off: foundation models enable efficient single-image reconstruction but lack fine geometric detail, while optimization-based methods achieve higher fidelity but require dense views and expensive computation. We bridge this gap with a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method introduces a multi-view surface normal prediction model that extends monocular foundation models with cross-view attention to produce geometrically consistent normals in a feed-forward pass. We then leverage these predictions as strong geometric priors within an inverse rendering optimization framework to recover high-frequency surface details.

    "abstract": "Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across clients by leveraging partially-annotated local data in a privacy-preserving manner. In FSSL, data heterogeneity is a challenging issue, which exists both across clients and within clients. External heterogeneity refers to the data distribution discrepancy across different clients, while internal heterogeneity represents the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data within clients. Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server (external) and / or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client (internal). But, the former is hard to precisely fit the ideal global distribution via direct weights, and the latter results in fewer data participation into FL training. To this end, we propose a proxy-guided framework called ProxyFL that focuses on simultaneously mitigating external and internal heterogeneity via a unified proxy. I.e., we consider the learnable weights of classifier as proxy to simulate the category distribution both locally and globally. For external, we explicitly optimize global proxy against outliers instead of direct weights; for internal, we re-include the discarded samples into training by a positive-negative proxy pool to mitigate the impact of potentially-incorrect pseudo-labels. Insight experiments & theoretical analysis show our significant performance and convergence in FSSL.",

We propose Localized Dynamics-Aware Domain Adaptation (LoDADA), which exploits localized dynamics mismatch to better reuse source data. LoDADA clusters transitions from source and target datasets and estimates cluster-level dynamics discrepancy via domain discrimination. Source transitions from clusters with small discrepancy are retained, while those from clusters with large discrepancy are filtered out. This yields a fine-grained and scalable data selection strategy that avoids overly coarse global assumptions and expensive per-sample filtering. We provide theoretical insights and extensive experiments across environments with diverse global and local dynamics shifts.

Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity.",

We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action.

More advanced techniques, such as Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer or activation offloading, can further extend the possible context length at the cost of training throughput. In this paper, we present UPipe, a simple yet effective context parallelism technique that performs fine-grained chunking at the attention head level. This technique significantly reduces the activation memory usage of self-attention, breaking the activation memory barrier and unlocking much longer context lengths. Our approach reduces intermediate tensor memory usage in the attention layer by as much as 87.5$\\%$ for 32B Transformers, while matching previous context parallelism techniques in terms of training speed.

In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis. This limitation is especially apparent for continuous and geometrically complex structures such as membranes, which are segmented as single entities. Here, we developed TomoROIS-SurfORA, a two step framework for direct, shape-agnostic ROI segmentation and morphological surface analysis. TomoROIS performs deep learning-based ROI segmentation and can be trained from scratch using small annotated datasets, enabling practical application across diverse imaging data. SurfORA processes segmented structures as point clouds and surface meshes to extract quantitative morphological features, including inter-membrane distances, curvature, and surface roughness. It supports both closed and open surfaces, with specific considerations for open surfaces, which are common in cryo-ET due to the missing wedge effect. We demonstrate both tools using in vitro reconstituted membrane systems containing deformable vesicles with complex geometries, enabling automatic quantitative analysis of membrane contact sites and remodeling events such as invagination. While demonstrated here on cryo-ET membrane data, the combined approach is applicable to ROI detection and surface analysis in broader scientific imaging contexts.",

    "abstract": "We study the complexity of smoothed agnostic learning, recently introduced by~\\cite{CKKMS24}, in which the learner competes with the best classifier in a target class under slight Gaussian perturbations of the inputs. Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\\tilde{O}(1/σ^2) \\log(1/ε)}$, where $σ$ is the smoothing parameter and $ε$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{Ω(1/σ^{2}+\\log(1/ε))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces.",

However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control. HVG achieves this through three key designs: (i) Articulated Pose Modulation, which captures the anatomical relationships of 3D joints via a novel dual-dimensional bone map and resolves self-occlusions across views by introducing 3D information; (ii) View and Temporal Alignment, which ensures multi-view consistency and alignment between a reference image and pose sequences for frame-to-frame stability; and (iii) Progressive Spatio-Temporal Sampling with temporal alignment to maintain smooth transitions in long multi-view animations. Extensive experiments on image-to-video tasks demonstrate that HVG outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 4D human videos from diverse human images and pose inputs.",

    "abstract": "While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit exceptional 2D visual understanding, their ability to comprehend and reason about 3D space--a cornerstone of spatial intelligence--remains superficial. Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods. These results highlight PSFM as a scalable path toward advancing spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Spa3R.",

We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that generalize prior methods and apply to arbitrary noise processes. When paired with uniform-state diffusion, our samplers outperform ancestral sampling on both language and image modeling, achieving lower generative perplexity at matched unigram entropy on OpenWebText and better FID/IS scores on CIFAR10. Crucially, unlike conventional samplers, our PC methods continue to improve with more sampling steps. Taken together, these findings call into question the assumption that Masked diffusion is the inevitable future of diffusion-based language modeling. Beyond sampling, we develop a memory-efficient curriculum for the Gaussian relaxation training phase, reducing training time by 25% and memory by 33% compared to Duo while maintaining comparable perplexity on OpenWebText and LM1B and strong downstream performance.

In many applications, Euclidean shortest paths form the underpinning of the navigation system.

Applied to 2,723 COVID-19 patients (383 Long COVID heart failure cases, 2,340 matched controls), we demonstrate that 38-67% of patients with chronic conditions would require biologically impossible counterfactuals under naive methods. We identify a cardiorenal cascade (CKD -> AKI -> HF) with relative risks of 2.27 and 1.19 at each step, illustrating temporal propagation that sequential -- but not naive -- counterfactuals can capture.

    "abstract": "In safety-critical classification, the cost of failure is often asymmetric, yet Bayesian deep learning summarises epistemic uncertainty with a single scalar, mutual information (MI), that cannot distinguish whether a model's ignorance involves a benign or safety-critical class. We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=σ_k^{2}/(2μ_k)$, with $μ_k{=}\\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $σ_k^2{=}\\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/μ_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across rare and common classes. By construction $\\sum_k C_k \\approx \\mathrm{MI}$, and a companion skewness diagnostic flags inputs where the approximation degrades. After characterising the axiomatic properties of $C_k$, we validate it on three tasks: (i) selective prediction for diabetic retinopathy, where critical-class $C_k$ reduces selective risk by 34.7\\% over MI and 56.2\\% over variance baselines; (ii) out-of-distribution detection on clinical and image benchmarks, where $\\sum_k C_k$ achieves the highest AUROC and the per-class view exposes asymmetric shifts invisible to MI; and (iii) a controlled label-noise study in which $\\sum_k C_k$ shows less sensitivity to injected aleatoric noise than MI under end-to-end Bayesian training, while both metrics degrade under transfer learning. Across all tasks, the quality of the posterior approximation shapes uncertainty at least as strongly as the choice of metric, suggesting that how uncertainty is propagated through the network matters as much as how it is measured.",

SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability.

Recent multimodal approaches that integrate ECGs with accompanying clinical reports show strong potential, but they still face two main concerns from a modality perspective: (1) intra-modality: existing models process ECGs in a lead-agnostic manner, overlooking spatial-temporal dependencies across leads, which restricts their effectiveness in modeling fine-grained diagnostic patterns; (2) inter-modality: existing methods directly align ECG signals with clinical reports, introducing modality-specific biases due to the free-text nature of the reports. In light of these two issues, we propose CG-DMER, a contrastive-generative framework for disentangled multimodal ECG representation learning, powered by two key designs: (1) Spatial-temporal masked modeling is designed to better capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and inter-lead spatial dependencies by applying masking across both spatial and temporal dimensions and reconstructing the missing information.

    "abstract": "We present SPRITETOMESH, a fully automatic pipeline for converting 2D game sprite images into triangle meshes compatible with skeletal animation frameworks such as Spine2D. Creating animation-ready meshes is traditionally a tedious manual process requiring artists to carefully place vertices along visual boundaries, a task that typically takes 15-60 minutes per sprite. Our method addresses this through a hybrid learned-algorithmic approach. A segmentation network (EfficientNet-B0 encoder with U-Net decoder) trained on over 100,000 sprite-mask pairs from 172 games achieves an IoU of 0.87, providing accurate binary masks from arbitrary input images. From these masks, we extract exterior contour vertices using Douglas-Peucker simplification with adaptive arc subdivision, and interior vertices along visual boundaries detected via bilateral-filtered multi-channel Canny edge detection with contour-following placement. Delaunay triangulation with mask-based centroid filtering produces the final mesh. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that direct vertex position prediction via neural network heatmap regression is fundamentally not viable for this task: the heatmap decoder consistently fails to converge (loss plateau at 0.061) while the segmentation decoder trains normally under identical conditions. We attribute this to the inherently artistic nature of vertex placement - the same sprite can be meshed validly in many different ways. This negative result validates our hybrid design: learned segmentation where ground truth is unambiguous, algorithmic placement where domain heuristics are appropriate. The complete pipeline processes a sprite in under 3 seconds, representing a speedup of 300x-1200x over manual creation. We release our trained model to the game development community.",

    "abstract": "Selective state space models (SSMs) have rapidly become a compelling backbone for large language models, especially for long-context workloads. Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path. This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead.",

For non-accelerated local methods, the best known worst-case work scales as $\\widetilde{O} ((αρ)^{-1})$, where $α$ is the teleportation parameter and $ρ$ is the $\\ell_1$-regularization parameter. A natural question is whether FISTA can improve the dependence on $α$ from $1/α$ to $1/\\sqrtα$ while preserving the $1/ρ$ locality scaling. The challenge is that acceleration can break locality by transiently activating nodes that are zero at optimality, thereby increasing the cost of gradient evaluations. We analyze FISTA on a slightly over-regularized objective and show that, under a checkable confinement condition, all spurious activations remain inside a boundary set $\\mathcal{B}$. This yields a bound consisting of an accelerated $(ρ\\sqrtα)^{-1}\\log(α/\\varepsilon)$ term plus a boundary overhead $\\sqrt{vol(\\mathcal{B})}/(ρα^{3/2})$.

Unlike standard VQ-VAE, SOM-VQ uses topology-aware updates that preserve neighborhood structure: nearby tokens on a learned grid correspond to semantically similar states, enabling direct geometric manipulation of the latent space. We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints. We focus on human motion generation - a domain where kinematic structure, smooth temporal continuity, and interactive use cases (choreography, rehabilitation, HCI) make topology-aware control especially natural - demonstrating controlled divergence and convergence from reference sequences through simple grid-based sampling. SOM-VQ provides a general framework for interpretable discrete representations applicable to music, gesture, and other interactive generative domains.",

Our extensions improve performance in multi-class settings with unequal variance-covariance structures and nonlinear class separations by allowing more splits and more flexible class groupings in the projection pursuit computation. Proposing algorithmic improvements is straightforward; demonstrating their actual utility is not. We therefore develop two visual diagnostic approaches to verify that the enhancements perform as intended. Using high-dimensional visualization techniques, we examine model fits on benchmark datasets to assess whether the algorithm behaves as theorized. An interactive web application enables users to explore the behavior of both the original and enhanced classifiers under controlled scenarios.

    "abstract": "We revisit the central online problem of ski rental in the \"algorithms with predictions\" framework from the point of view of distributional predictions. Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} < o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error. We complement this upper bound with a variety of lower bounds showing that it is essentially tight: not only can the consistency/robustness tradeoff not be improved, but our particular loss function cannot be meaningfully improved.",

Existing approaches typically fall into two extremes: direct inference methods are computationally prohibitive for large-scale retrieval, while embedding-based methods primarily focus on unilateral feature augmentation rather than holistic collaborative signal enhancement. To bridge this gap, we propose Topology-Augmented Graph Collaborative Filtering (TAGCF), a novel framework that transforms semantic knowledge into topological connectivity. Unlike existing approaches that depend on textual features or direct interaction synthesis, TAGCF employs LLMs to infer interaction intents and underlying causal relationships from user-item pairs, representing these insights as intermediate attribute nodes within an enriched User-Attribute-Item (U-A-I) graph. Furthermore, to effectively model the heterogeneous relations in this augmented structure, we propose Adaptive Relation-weighted Graph Convolution (ARGC), which employs relation-specific prediction networks to dynamically estimate the importance of each relation type. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and CF backbones demonstrate consistent improvements, with comprehensive evaluations including cold-start scenarios validating the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

The key to achieving this goal is being able to recognize zone occupancy in real time, without impeding occupants' activities or compromising privacy. While low-resolution, privacy-preserving time-of-flight (ToF) sensor networks have demonstrated good performance in zone counting, the performance depends on careful sensor placement. To address this issue, we propose an automatic sensor placement method that determines optimal sensor layouts for a given number of sensors, and can predict the counting accuracy of such a layout. In particular, given the geometric constraints of an office environment, we simulate a large number of occupant trajectories. We then formulate the sensor placement problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem and solve it with the branch and bound method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method based on simulations of several different office environments.",

    "abstract": "Customer-provided reviews have become an important source of information for business owners and other customers alike. However, effectively analyzing millions of unstructured reviews remains challenging. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for natural language understanding, their application to large-scale review analysis has been limited by computational costs and scalability concerns. This study proposes a hybrid approach that uses LLMs for aspect identification while employing classic machine-learning methods for sentiment classification at scale. Using ChatGPT to analyze sampled restaurant reviews, we identified key aspects of dining experiences and developed sentiment classifiers using human-labeled reviews, which we subsequently applied to 4.7 million reviews collected over 17 years from a major online platform. Regression analysis reveals that our machine-labeled aspects significantly explain variance in overall restaurant ratings across different aspects of dining experiences, cuisines, and geographical regions. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLMs with traditional machine learning approaches can effectively automate aspect-based sentiment analysis of large-scale customer feedback, suggesting a practical framework for both researchers and practitioners in the hospitality industry and potentially, other service sectors.",
